## Welcome to my Website!

Hello there! This is my first time really keeping a log or journal like this. I plan to document things from my software development journey, personal life experiences, travels, and pretty much anything else I feel like talking about and sharing.
<br>
This website will also be where I showcase my portfolio, covering both programming and video editing. Honestly, other social media platforms aren't really my thing, so I prefer this kind of devlog or journal style. It feels like creating my own little corner on the vast internet where I can share my thoughts.
<br>
So, whether you're a potential client or just passing through, you're welcome here! Stick around if you want to learn more, or if you just want to pick up some specific info, that's cool too â€“ I'm happy to share what I've learned along the way.
