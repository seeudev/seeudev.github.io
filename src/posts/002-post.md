## Finals month

Hello there! just a quick little update, Its a little bit busy this month, got caught up playing a fun little game called Fire Emblem: Three Houses
which really took my time from doing the actual projects for finals. Anyways its a busy month finishing up the projects we started for this semester
and I really look forward to completing them and showcasing it, though most of it will be AI assisted as every code these recent years with the
rapid advancements of AIs or LLMs. Fun fact most of the process making this website was entirely AI assisted with the Gemini Code Assist and Gemini Advanced in the web as I got myself a month of free trial using it. Anyways its coming to an end this 27th and I hope to make good use out of it finishing up all my projects needed for this semester. Thats all for this log and I'll update soon!
