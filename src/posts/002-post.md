## Finals month

Hello there! Just a quick update: it's been a busy month for me. I've been caught up playing a fun game called Fire Emblem: Three Houses, which has taken some time away from my final projects. 
<br>
As the semester wraps up, I'm focused on completing the projects we started earlier, and Iâ€™m excited to showcase what we've done. Many of these projects have been assisted by AI, especially with the recent advancements in AI and LLMs. Interestingly, the process of creating this website was largely AI-assisted using Gemini Code Assist and Gemini Advanced, which I accessed through a month-long free trial.
<br>
My trial ends on the 27th, and I hope to make the most of it to finish all my required projects for the semester. That's all for this log, and I'll update you soon!
