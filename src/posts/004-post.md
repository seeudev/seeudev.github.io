## Updates..updates

Hello, it’s been a while since I last posted a blog…
<br>
Honestly, things haven't been very eventful lately. There's this common theme I keep finding in media I enjoy: the feeling of being stuck or lost, often correlated with stagnant water, where everything bad festers. That's exactly how I've been feeling, due to some circumstances I can't or don't feel I need to disclose here.
<br>
<br>
Looking at my previous entries, I was quite excited for summer and even had a plan, but now I feel like I've wasted an entire season, barely doing any of the things I planned. With the academic year started and the workload beginning to pile up, I’m even wondering how I’ll manage to write another entry in this blog.
<br>
<br>
Reflecting right now, I truly want to be better for myself and do better, starting small and taking small victories one at a time. I know this might be an unusual entry to log, but I feel it deserves a spot here to document this moment and look back on it in the future.
<br>
<br>
Future Me Check-in
<br>
Looking at you, future me! I hope you are doing well and better than ever.
<br>
I'm currently listening to Kenshi Yonezu's latest song release, "Jane Doe," while writing this. I know you remember how you feel when you listen to certain songs, so hopefully, this will help you recall this moment. Sorry for that future-me bit letter—I thought it would be a good little Easter egg for myself to find later.
<br>
<br>
As of writing, it's 3 AM, and I’m taking a break from creating projects that are at a breakneck pace with how fast they expect us to make the deliverables. It’s tiring, but at least it's possible to do.
<bf>
<br>
It's also just days after an earthquake hit the area I live in. It’s saddening how people die, especially with the recent issues in our country's politics, because of substandard infrastructures and corrupt politicians taking taxpayers' money. Recent calamities have only further exposed these anomalies. Here we are, the every-man, just surviving and getting by each day.
<br>
<br>
I wish things could be better, but looking at my situation, I’m blessed to have a roof over my head and fortunate enough that my main worry is school. I’m just letting it all out—my thoughts and everything I could think of right now.
<br>
<br>
Perhaps continuing to update and blog more consistently will improve how I’m feeling and overall just improve my skills. I plan to revamp this website soon, moving from using Eleventy to using another framework, as that’s what we’re currently studying. I plan to implement what I learn from university here. I found a pretty good website, reactbits.dev, to add dynamic items to my site. I really like the modularity of React and plan to learn more and integrate it into my website soon.
<br>
So, this will be all for this entry. See you all next time!
